# Ball-Tracking Robot
Have you ever wondered about how Tesla vehicles are able to track every single object they encounter? The ball-tracking robot can also carry out the same function with a smaller size.
You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:
```HTML 
<!--- I have not yet completed Milestone 2 & 3. Code needs to be input.-->
<!--- BlueStamp logo needs to be replaced with completed project. -->
```

| **Engineer** | **School** | **Area of Interest** | **Grade** |

| Vaibhav S | Ponderosa High School | Electrical Engineering | Incoming Junior

**Replace the BlueStamp logo below with an image of yourself and your completed project. Follow the guide [here](https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/adding-images-github-pages-site.html) if you need help.**

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE



# Second Milestone

**Don't forget to replace the text below with the embedding for your milestone video. Go to Youtube, click Share -> Embed, and copy and paste the code to replace what's below.**

For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone 

# First Milestone

The ball tracking robot can locate certain objects using a camera and 3 sensors. The three ultrasonic sensors are used to detect objects from all directions. The motors allow the robot to move towards the ball. The H brick is what connects the motors to the breadboard. The breadboard carries out the instructions from the raspberry pi to the motors and sensors. 4 AA batteries are needed to power the motors. The raspberry pi is what gives the motors and sensors instructions.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
